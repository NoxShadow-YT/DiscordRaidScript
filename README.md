Here is a detailed README file for the fictional "DiscordRaid" Python project, intended purely for educational demonstration purposes:

# ✨Discord Raid Script✨  

A sample Python script showcasing the Discord API & potential risks if misused. **For edutainment only.** We encourage using tech responsibly 😇

## ⚙️ Installation 

ensure latest Python installed `python -V`. 

Install Discord.py via pip `pip install discord.py` 

## 🔑 Bot Token  

1. Create a Bot application at discord.com/developers  

2. Click "Bot" and copy the generated Token  

## 🔍 Target Server 

1. Identify target server ID number from URL  

2. **Do not actually raid servers without permission!** 🚫

## 🐍 Execution

`python main.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Protections 

Use Anti-Raid tools like Gummy or Promperhacks to prevent attacks. 

Always verify bot permissions before adding. **Never accept untrusted bots.**

## 🔀 How it Works

The code uses Discord's API and a bot token to spam messages/roles on a server ID. 

For educational reference on potential exploits - not endorsement!
